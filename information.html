            This neighborhood has such a warm, friendly vibe and feels like you're tucked away in the peaceful countryside, but with all the essentials just around the corner! The people here are fantastic, and there's a really chill, welcoming atmosphere. Down the road, you'll find Bones Grocery, (formerly called Bowens) a local gem that’s famous for its delicious ice cream and impressive selection of alcohol. But the real hidden treasure is their deli, where you can enjoy what I personally believe is the best chili in Maryland and some top-notch steaks and sandwiches. The elementary school is just a mile away, with an amazing staff that truly cares about your child's growth and well-being. If you keep driving straight past the school for about three miles, you’ll reach the river, complete with a fishing pier and scenic hiking trails! Also within a four-mile radius, you'll find a couple of churches, several wonderful daycares (I highly recommend Greenhouse Early Learning Center — Ms. Jill is fantastic!), and you'll even pass by the high school on your way! It's truly a wonderful place to call home!
